## SecretAccessor interface

Callback-based secret accessor with auto-zeroing.

The accessor is backed by a revocable Proxy. Calling `read()` passes a `Buffer` containing the secret to the callback, then zeroes the buffer after the callback returns. The accessor can only be read once; a second call throws.

**Signature:**

```typescript
interface SecretAccessor 
```

Read the secret value via a callback.

The `buf` argument is a temporary `Buffer` containing the secret encoded as UTF-8. The buffer is zeroed immediately after the callback returns, so callers must not store a reference to it beyond the callback scope.
