## VaultKeeper.revokeKey() method

Emergency key revocation — invalidates the previous key immediately.

After revocation, any JWE that was encrypted with the revoked key will be permanently unreadable. A new encryption key is generated automatically so that `setup()` can be called immediately after revocation.

**Signature:**

```typescript
revokeKey(): Promise<void>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;void&gt;
